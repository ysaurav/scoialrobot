# Evaluation #

The methods we have used to evaluate are based on Euclidean distance. We have used two approaches:

1. The mean of the distances between the ground-truth and our results.

2. Confusion matrix.

In the previous table:

RGB+HS - represents the results for detection using RGB detector and tracking using Hue and Saturation.

RGBD+HS - represents the results for detection using combined RGB detector with depth detector and tracking using Hue and Saturation.

RGBD+HSD - represents the results for detection using RGB detector with depth detector and tracking using Hue, Saturation and Depth tracking.
